# FYP Shepherding Algorithm Simulation

This is my university final year project.
The project consists of a simulation created in the Unity Engine. The focus of the project is to develop a shepherding/herding algorithm that can successfully and efficiently herd swarms which follow various swarming algorithms.

To run the latest build, download the "Builds" folder and run the .exe file.
